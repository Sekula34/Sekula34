### About me 
Hi there! 👋

I'm Filip, a **university bachelor of informatics** graduate from the [Faculty of Organization and Informatics](https://www.foi.unizg.hr/en), University of Zagreb (July 2023). My study program focused on **business systems**, but I’ve been diving deeper into programming since starting the **[42 Vienna](https://www.42vienna.com/en/) Common Core** in September 2023. I expect to finish by May 2025.

I’m currently looking for my first junior developer job or internship in the EU and would love to start in **May/June** 2025.

I’m passionate about learning, coding, Formula 1 🏎️, and tackling new challenges.

#### Languages I know:

- **Programming**:
	- C
	- C++ (C++98, but I’m happy to learn newer standards if needed)
	- bit of Python.  
	- I’m confident I can pick up any language required for the job.
- **Spoken**:
	- **Croatian**: Native
	- **English**: Fluent
	- German: Beginner (still learning—don’t expect too much just yet 😅).
